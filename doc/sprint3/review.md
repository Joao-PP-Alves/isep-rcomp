RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 3 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1170640 (Ricardo Mourisco) ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
Regarding Sprint 3, we were asked to improve on our campus set up, deploying multiple functions (using Cisco Packet Tracer).
In terms of knowledge, the focus is on the DHCP, OSPF, DNS, NAT, HTTP, VoIP and Firewall ACL and how all these interact on a network.
On this document are specified the common technical decisions for all the buildings to follow. These were decided in group and will be explained ahead.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
Respecting the divisions made in the last sprint, each member created the network simulation to the previously given building.

One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

* Totally implemented with no issues
* Totally implemented with issues
* Partially implemented with no issues
* Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.

## 2.1. 1191513 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1. #
* Totally implemented with no issues.

## 2.2. 1190743 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2. #
* Totally implemented with no issues.

## 2.3. 1182147 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 3. #
* Totally implemented with no issues.

## 2.4. 1170640 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 4 + Final integration of each memberâ€™s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. #
* No ACL configuration on campus.
* Everything else: Totally implemented with no issues.
