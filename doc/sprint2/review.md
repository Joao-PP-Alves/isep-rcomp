RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 2 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1190743 (Jo√£o Alves) ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
Regarding Sprint 2, this team is now, using the last project made, asked to create a network simulation (using Cisco Packet Tracer).
In terms of knowledge, the focus is on the layer two infrastructure and the layer three fundamentals, such as IPv4 addressing and static routing.
On this document are specified the common technical decisions for all the buildings to follow. These were decided in group and will be explained ahead.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
Respecting the divisions made in the last sprint, each member created the network simulation to the previously given building.

One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

* Totally implemented with no issues
* Totally implemented with issues
* Partially implemented with no issues
* Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.

## 2.1. 1191513 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 1, and also encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every members' Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation. #
* Totally implemented with no issues.
## 2.2. 1190743 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 2, and also encompassing the campus backbone. Writing the planning.md as Sprint Master #
* Totally implemented with no issues.
## 2.3. 1182147 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 3, and also encompassing the campus backbone. #
* Totally implemented with no issues.
## 2.4. 1170640 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building 4, and also encompassing the campus backbone. #
* Totally implemented with no issues.
